## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please:

1. Read this contribution guide thoroughly
2. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/OpenSecFlow/netdriver/issues) to see if your concern is already being addressed
3. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change
4. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`

## Development Environment Setup

- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/netdriver.git
   cd netdriver
   ```

2. **Install Python (using pyenv)**

   ```bash
   # Install pyenv if not already installed
   curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash

   # Install Python 3.12.7
   pyenv install 3.12.7
   pyenv local 3.12.7
   ```

3. **Install uv**

   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

   ```

5. **Verify Installation**

   ```bash
   # Run tests to ensure everything is working
   uv run pytest
   ```

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to NetDriver:

- **Report bugs** - Help us identify and fix issues
- **Suggest features** - Share ideas for new functionality
- **Write documentation** - Improve or expand our docs
- **Add device plugins** - Extend support for more network devices
- **Fix bugs** - Submit pull requests for known issues
- **Improve code quality** - Refactoring, optimization, and code cleanup

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. **Follow PEP 8** - Python code should adhere to [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
2. **Use Type Hints** - Add type annotations to function signatures
3. **Write Docstrings** - Document modules, classes, and functions using Google-style docstrings
4. **Keep It Simple** - Write clear, readable code; avoid unnecessary complexity

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Optional

async def execute_command(
    device_ip: str,
    command: str,
    timeout: int = 30
) -> dict:
    """Execute a command on a network device.

    Args:
        device_ip: IP address of the target device
        command: CLI command to execute
        timeout: Command execution timeout in seconds

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing command output and execution status

    Raises:
        ExecCmdTimeout: If command execution exceeds timeout
        LoginFailed: If authentication fails
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Refactor")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description in the body if needed

**Good examples:**

```text
Add Cisco ASA plugin support

Fix session timeout handling in SessionPool
- Properly handle expired sessions
- Add reconnection logic
- Update tests

Update documentation for plugin development
```

**Bad examples:**

```text
fixed stuff
update
changes
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that reflect the work:

- `feature/add-cisco-asa-plugin`
- `fix/session-timeout-handling`
- `docs/update-plugin-guide`
- `refactor/improve-error-handling`

## Adding a New Device Plugin

NetDriver uses a plugin architecture to support different network devices. Here's how to add a new plugin:

### 1. Create Plugin File

Create a new file under `components/netdriver/plugins/[vendor]/`:

```bash
components/netdriver/plugins/cisco/cisco_asa.py
```

### 2. Implement Plugin Class

```python
from netdriver_agent.plugin.plugin_info import PluginInfo
from netdriver_agent.plugins.cisco import CiscoBase

class CiscoASA(CiscoBase):
    """Cisco ASA Firewall Plugin."""

    info = PluginInfo(
        vendor="cisco",
        model="asa",
        version="base",
        description="Cisco ASA Firewall Plugin"
    )

    def get_mode_prompt_patterns(self) -> dict:
        """Define prompt patterns for each mode."""
        return {
            "LOGIN": r"[\r\n][\w\-\.]+>\s*$",
            "ENABLE": r"[\r\n][\w\-\.]+#\s*$",
            "CONFIG": r"[\r\n][\w\-\.]+\(config[^\)]*\)#\s*$",
        }

    def get_more_pattern(self) -> str:
        """Pattern for pagination prompts."""
        return r"<--- More --->"

    def get_error_patterns(self) -> list:
        """Patterns that indicate command errors."""
        return [
            r"% Invalid",
            r"% Incomplete",
            r"% Unknown",
        ]
```

### 3. Add Tests

Create corresponding test file:

```bash
tests/bases/netdriver/agent/test_cisco_asa.py
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Add the new plugin to the supported devices list in the README.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=components --cov=bases

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/bases/netdriver/agent/test_cisco_nexus.py

# Run unit tests only
uv run pytest -m unit

# Run integration tests only
uv run pytest -m integration
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use meaningful test names

**Example test:**

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient

@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_execute_command_success(client: AsyncClient):
    """Test successful command execution."""
    response = await client.post(
        "/api/v1/exec",
        json={
            "ip": "192.168.1.1",
            "username": "admin",
            "password": "password",
            "commands": ["show version"]
        }
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "output" in response.json()
```
